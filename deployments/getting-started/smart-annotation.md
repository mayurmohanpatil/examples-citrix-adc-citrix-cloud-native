# Getting Started with Citrix Cloud Native
This section gets you started with a very simple configuration and provides some example configurations.
This is the fastest way to get started using Citrix Cloud native deployments. 
We will use minikube (single-node Kubernetes cluster) to demonstrate the below use cases;
* How do I load balance the guestbook microservice app using CPX in Kubernetes cluster
* How do I apply smart annotation to CPX
* How do I apply rewrite responder policy to CPX
* How do I throttle the ingress traffic rate applying rate limiting policy to CPX
* How do I apply HTTP profile to CPX using smart annotations.
* How do I change the default load balancing method using annotations.
